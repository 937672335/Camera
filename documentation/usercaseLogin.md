# Use Case: Estimating Insulin Dosage from Food Image

## Use case number: UC-002

### Use case name: Estimating Insulin Dosage from Food Image

### Description and goal:
This use case allows the user to upload a photo of a meal, which the system processes to estimate the number of carbohydrates and suggest the appropriate insulin dosage based on the user's carb-to-insulin ratio and real-time blood glucose levels.

### Actor:
- **User**: A person with diabetes requiring insulin management.

### Primary actor:
- **User**

### Stakeholders:
- **Users**: Want an accurate and easy way to calculate insulin dosage for meals.
- **Doctors/Healthcare Providers**: Benefit from accurate insulin management by their patients.
- **Developers**: Ensure the system works reliably and securely.

### Pre-conditions:
- The user has entered a valid carb-to-insulin ratio in the app.
- The system has access to real-time blood glucose levels via Dexcom's API.
- The user has taken a clear photo of a food item.

### Triggers:
- The user uploads a photo of the food item and requests an insulin dosage estimation.

### Post-conditions:
- **Success**: The system returns an estimated insulin dosage to the user based on the carbohydrate content in the food and the userâ€™s real-time blood glucose levels.
- **Failure**: The system provides an error message if the image is unrecognizable or if data from the APIs cannot be retrieved.

### Basic flow:
1. The user takes a photo of the food item.
2. The user uploads the photo through the app.
3. The system sends the photo to OpenAI's API to identify the food and estimate its carbohydrate content.
4. The system retrieves the user's real-time blood glucose levels using the Dexcom API.
5. The system uses the carb-to-insulin ratio provided by the user to calculate the required insulin dosage.
6. The system returns the insulin dosage estimate to the user.

### Alternative path:
- **Unrecognized Image**:  
  - If the system cannot identify the food in the photo, an error message is displayed: "Unable to recognize food. Please try again with a clearer image."
  
- **Missing Blood Glucose Data**:  
  - If the Dexcom API is unavailable or fails to return data, an error message is displayed: "Unable to retrieve blood glucose levels. Please try again later."
  
- **Incorrect Carb-to-Insulin Ratio**:  
  - If the carb-to-insulin ratio is missing or invalid, the system prompts the user to update it before processing the request.
